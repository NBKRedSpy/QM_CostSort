# Quasimorph Cost Sort

![Items in descending cost order](media/thumbnail.png)

Mo' Money Mo' Better, that's our motto!

This mod Changes the inventory sort to include the cost in the sort. 

This makes items that are more expensive (and generally more powerful) begin at the left of each item type grouping.

Sort order is:

|Criteria|New|
|--|--|
|Item type||
|Slots item takes||
|Cost (descending)|yes|
|Item  Id||
