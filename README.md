# Quasimorph Improved Sort

![Items in descending cost order](media/thumbnail.png)

This mod was previously known as "Cost Sort".

This mod's sort orders items so that the best items are first based on cost, remaining durability, uses remaining, when it expires, and more.
This allows the user to only need to look at the first item of a item type section to see which is most likely the best.

The [Sort Excess Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3481043805) further extends this mod.  Check it out to avoid scrolling through pages of the same item.
